# Deliverables Namespace

This directory groups non-core project materials to keep the repository root focused on reproducible code and results.

## Subdirectories

- `deliverables/archive/`: historical development notes, prior docs, and archived logs.
- `deliverables/mentor_review/`: mentor-facing package and supporting summaries.
- `deliverables/skeletons_and_fact_sheets/`: narrative skeletons, fact sheets, and supporting visuals.
- `reproduce_output/`: archived reproduction outputs from earlier runs.

## Core Reproducibility Paths (unchanged)

Core workflows still live at the repository root:

- `src/`
- `scripts/`
- `data/`
- `results/`
- `aggregated_results/`
- `tests/`
- `tutorials/`

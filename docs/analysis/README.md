- `single_cell_baselines.md`: per-dataset single-cell baseline results and ranking.
- `single_cell_lsft.md`: corrected single-cell LSFT outcomes and why the lift is small.
- `single_cell_logo.md`: single-cell LOGO generalization summary.
- `cross_resolution_pseudobulk_vs_single_cell.md`: transfer of the main qualitative conclusions across resolutions.
- `gears_comparison.md`: direct comparison of self-trained PCA versus GEARS perturbation embeddings.

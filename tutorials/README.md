# Tutorials

This directory intentionally contains one maintained notebook:

- `tutorial_end_to_end_results.ipynb`

It is the public walkthrough for the repo. It does three things:

1. locates the repository root
2. runs the end-to-end results demo script
3. inspects the committed summary tables and markdown conclusions

The larger goal-by-goal teaching notebooks were removed to keep the repository focused on the final reproducible result rather than classroom scaffolding.
